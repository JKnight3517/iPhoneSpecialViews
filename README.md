# iPhoneSpecialViews
This is an example app for users (myself included) to reference and understand how to set up a UIIMagePickerController, UIActivityViewController, and UIAlertViewController.

Each of these views require a bit of wiring up correctly and it's nice to have something that's just not a code snippet but an actual functioning project.

Let me know if there are more views I should add that are tricky to set up and I'll set them up!
